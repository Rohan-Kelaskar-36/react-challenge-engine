# Challenge 03: Mutations and Optimistic Updates

## Overview

Implement mutations (create, update, delete) with optimistic updates.

## Problem Statement

Add mutation endpoints to create, update, and delete users or posts. Implement optimistic updates for better UX.

## Instructions

1. Add mutation endpoints (`createUser`, `updateUser`, `deleteUser`)
2. Implement optimistic updates
3. Create forms/components for mutations
4. Handle success and error states
5. Show how mutations invalidate cache tags

## Visual Requirements

- Form to create new users/posts
- Ability to edit existing items
- Delete functionality
- Optimistic UI updates (immediate feedback)
- Success/error notifications

## How to Verify

1. Run `npm run dev` and open the app
2. Navigate to `/challenge/03-mutations` (or click "View Challenge UI" from the home page)
3. Create a new user/post - should appear immediately (optimistic)
4. Edit an item - should update optimistically
5. Delete an item - should remove optimistically
6. Check Redux DevTools for mutation state
